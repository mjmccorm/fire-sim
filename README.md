Fire Department Simulator

The Fire Department Simulator will allow fire departments to develop training scenarios based on local imagery, maps, and weather conditions.

Smoke, Fire, Electrical, and Liquid spills are types of scenarios that will be supported.

I have a separate project, Mass Casualty Incident Simulator (MCI-Sim), that can be used to train on medical incidents.
